 Product Recommendation System üõíüí°  

Welcome to the **Product Recommendation System** GitHub repository! This project demonstrates the implementation of a robust recommendation system using Python and AI/ML technologies. It is inspired by cutting-edge advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning, tailored to provide users with highly accurate and personalized product suggestions.



 üöÄ Project Highlights

- **AI/ML-Driven Recommendations**: Combines the power of collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid techniques.
- **Python-Powered**: Utilizes Python's rich ecosystem of libraries for data processing, machine learning, and visualization.
- **Customizable for Any Domain**: Adaptable to e-commerce, media, entertainment, or any other industry requiring personalized recommendations.
- **End-to-End Implementation**: From data ingestion to model training and deployment, all under one roof.

 ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies and Tools

### Programming Language:
- **Python**

### Core Libraries:
- **Pandas** and **NumPy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Surprise**: For advanced collaborative filtering.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For creating insightful visualizations.
- **Flask/Django** (Optional): For deploying the recommendation system via APIs.

### AI/ML Techniques:
- Collaborative Filtering (User-Based & Item-Based)
- Content-Based Filtering
- Hybrid Recommendations
- Dimensionality Reduction Techniques (e.g., SVD)
- Natural Language Processing (if using textual product data)



## üìã Features

1. **User Recommendations**: Provides product recommendations based on user preferences and historical behavior.
2. **Scalable Design**: Handles large datasets efficiently, suitable for enterprise applications.
3. **Visualization**: Offers insightful charts to analyze recommendation performance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/product-recommendation-system.git
   cd product-recommendation-system
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Add your dataset to the `data/` directory.

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Use

1. **Prepare the Data**:
   - Use `data_processing.py` to clean and preprocess your dataset.

2. **Train the Model**:
   - Run the training script:
     ```bash
     python src/train_model.py
     ```

3. **Get Recommendations**:
   - Generate recommendations for a specific user:
     ```bash
     python src/recommend.py --user_id <USER_ID>
     ```

4. **Web API Deployment** (Optional):
   - Start the web server:
     ```bash
     python src/app.py
     ```
   - Access the API at `http://localhost:5000`.

## üß™ Example Workflow

1. Analyze the dataset using Jupyter Notebook (`notebooks/`).
2. Train the model on user-product interactions.
3. Visualize the recommendation results.
4. Deploy the system for real-time use.
